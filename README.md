# My PLC Projects

This repository contains several projects related to automation and algorithms. Below are the files included in this repository:

## Files in this Repository:

### 1. *Box Sorting Algorithm* (boxsorting_algorithm.py)
This file contains a Python implementation of a Box Sorting Algorithm. It sorts boxes based on specific rules, such as size or weight. This can be used in logistics or warehouse automation systems.

### 2. *Simple and Double Jump Distance* (jump_distance.py)
This file contains an algorithm that calculates the distance for a jump. It includes both simple and double jump distances, which could be used in gaming simulations or robotics for calculating movement trajectories.

### 3. *Water Filling Automation* (water_filling_automation.lad)
This file is a PLC program for water filling automation. It controls the water filling process, likely used in industrial settings to automate the filling of containers with water based on predefined parameters.
